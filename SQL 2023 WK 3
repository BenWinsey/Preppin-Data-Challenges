instructions:
For the transactions file:
Filter the transactions to just look at DSB
These will be transactions that contain DSB in the Transaction Code field
Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values
Change the date to be the quarter
Sum the transaction values for each quarter and for each Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
For the targets file:
Pivot the quarterly targets so we have a row for each Type of Transaction and each Quarter
 Rename the fields
Remove the 'Q' from the quarter field and make the data type numeric
Join the two datasets together
You may need more than one join clause!
Remove unnecessary fields
Calculate the Variance to Target for each row.
