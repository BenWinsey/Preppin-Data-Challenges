Instructions:

In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string
Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check Digits of the receiving bank account
Add a field for the Country Code
Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
Create the IBAN as above
Hint: watch out for trying to combine sting fields with numeric fields - check data types
Remove unnecessary fields.
WITH myTable as (
select 
replace(sort_code, '-', '') as A_Sort_Code,
TRANSACTION_ID,
ACCOUNT_NUMBER,
A.BANK AS BANK,
SWIFT_CODE,
CHECK_DIGITS
from TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK02_TRANSACTIONS AS A
inner join TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK02_SWIFT_CODES AS B
on A.BANK=B.BANK)


Select 
TRANSACTION_ID,
concat ('GB', CHECK_DIGITS, SWIFT_CODE, A_SORT_CODE, ACCOUNT_NUMBER) AS IBAN
