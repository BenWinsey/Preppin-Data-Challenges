Instructions:
Join the data sets together to give us the grades per student
Remove the parental data fields, they aren't needed for the challenge this week
Pivot the data to create one row of data per student and subject
Rename the pivoted fields to Subject and Score 
Create an average score per student based on all of their grades
Create a field that records whether the student passed each subject
Pass mark is 75 and above in all subjects
Aggregate the data per student to count how many subjects each student passed
Round the average score per student to one decimal place
