Instructions:
First we must join the test score data set and the additional class attendance data set 
Clean Data: there’s a few spelling mistakes in the data set, use the data tool of your choice to correct these mistakes before we proceed. These mistakes are in the “Subject”  Column
Use a calculated field to clean up the test score column, so each number is a rounded to the nearest whole number
Split the student name column so we can see the first name and surname in two separate columns, named appropriately
If any student has an attendance percentage less than 70%, flag it as "Low Attendance" in a new column "attendance flag". Conversely, if above 90%, flag as “high attendance”. And anything else as “Medium”.  



Code:
select 
split_part(A.STUDENT_NAME, '_', 1) as First_Name,
split_part(A.STUDENT_NAME, '_', 2) as Last_Name,
ATTENDANCE_PERCENTAGE,
case
when attendance_percentage <0.7 then 'Low Attendance'
when attendance_percentage >=.9 then 'High Attendance'
else 'Low Attendance' end as Attendance_Flag,
STUDENT_ID,
case
when SUBJECT = 'Engish' then 'English'
when Subject = 'Sciece' then 'Science'
else subject end as Subject, 
round(TEST_SCORE) as Test_Score, 
TEST_DATE
from 
TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK22_ATTENDANCE_FIGURES as A
inner join TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK22_STUDENT_TEST_SCORES as B
on A.student_name = B. student_name
